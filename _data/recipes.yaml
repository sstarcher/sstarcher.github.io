  directions:
  - "1. Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet or straight-sided saut\xE9 pan over\
    \ high heat until shimmering. Add onion, red pepper, and chili and spread into\
    \ an even layer. Cook, without moving, until vegetables on the bottom are deeply\
    \ browned and beginning to char in spots, about 6 minutes. Stir and repeat. Continue\
    \ to cook until vegetables are fully softened and spottily charred, about another\
    \ 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, about\
    \ 30 seconds. Add paprika and cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about\
    \ 30 seconds. Immediately add tomatoes and stir to combine (see note). Reduce\
    \ heat to a bare simmer and simmer for 10 minutes, then season to taste with salt\
    \ and pepper and stir in half of cilantro or parsley."
  - 2. Using a large spoon, make a well near the perimeter of the pan and break an
    egg directly into it. Spoon a little sauce over edges of egg white to partially
    submerge and contain it, leaving yolk exposed. Repeat with remaining 5 eggs, working
    around pan as you go. Season eggs with a little salt, cover, reduce heat to lowest
    setting, and cook until egg whites are barely set and yolks are still runny, 5
    to 8 minutes.
  - 3. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro or parsley, along with any of the optional
    toppings. Serve immediately with crusty bread.

  directions:
  - Season eggplant slices lightly on both sides with salt. Place double layer of
    paper towels or clean kitchen towel on large plate and lay single layer of eggplant
    slices on top. Top with 2 more layers paper towels or clean kitchen towel. Top
    with second large plate and place another layer of paper towels and eggplant on
    top. Top with third large plate. Microwave on high power until eggplant is easily
    compressed, about 3 minutes (be careful, plates will be hot).
  - Working one piece of eggplant at a time, press firmly between paper towels until
    compressed. Set aside on a large tray. Repeat microwaving and pressing steps until
    all eggplant slices are compressed.
  - Puree tomatoes and their juice in a food mill, blender, or food processor until
    no pieces larger than 1/16th of an inch remain. Heat olive oil and butter in a
    large saucepan over medium high heat until butter is melted. Add garlic, 2 teaspoons
    oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about
    2 minutes. Add tomatoes, onion, half of parsley, and half or basil, bring to a
    simmer, turn heat to low, and cook until reduced by half, about 1 hour. Stir in
    half of remaining parsley and basil and season to taste with salt. Remove the
    onion and discard. Set aside.
  - Place flour in one wide mixing bowl, eggs and 1 teaspoon salt in second wide mixing
    bowl, and breadcrumbs, remaining 2 teaspoons oregano, and 1/4 up parmesan in third
    bowl. Working with one slice at a time, dredge eggplant in flour, dip in egg,
    and coat in seasoned bread crumbs. Transfer breaded eggplant to rimmed baking
    sheet.
  - "Preheat oven to 375\xB0F and adjust oven rack to center position. Line clean\
    \ rimmed baking sheet with double layer of paper towels. In a 12-inch non-stick\
    \ or cast iron skillet, heat oil to 375\xB0F. Carefully slide 3-4 eggplant slices\
    \ into hot oil in single layer. Cook, shaking pan occasionally until first side\
    \ is golden brown and crisp, about 2 1/2 minutes. Using tongs, carefully flip\
    \ eggplant and continue cooking, stirring occasionally until second side is crisp,\
    \ about 1 1/2 minutes longer. Transfer slices to paper-towel lined baking sheet\
    \ and season immediately with salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant slices."
  - In a 9- by 13-inch glass baking dish, spread 1/4 of tomato sauce over bottom.
    Add 1/3 of eggplant slices in single layer (they may overlap a little bit). Press
    down to form even layer. Add 1/4 of tomato sauce and spread evenly. Evenly spread
    1/3 of mozzarella and 1/3 of remaining parmesan over sauce. Repeat with two more
    layers each of eggplant, sauce, and cheese, reserving 1/4 cup of parmesan at the
    end.
  - Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake until light golden
    brown and bubble on surface, about 20 minutes longer. Remove from oven and sprinkle
    remaining parmesan over the top. Allow to rest for fifteen minutes, sprinkle with
    remaining parsley and basil, and serve.

  directions:
  - '1. For the Chicken: In a large mortar and pestle, pound garlic and salt until
    a smooth, sticky paste forms. Add cumin, paprika, black pepper, and vinegar and
    grind them together to form a paste. Drizzle in vegetable oil while grinding (see
    note). Transfer chicken and marinade to a large bowl and massage with your hands
    until all the chicken is coated in the marinade. Set aside at room temperature
    while you make the sauce, or cover and place in the fridge up to overnight.'
  - "2. For the Sauce: Combine jalape\xF1os, aj\xED amarillo (if using), cilantro,\
    \ garlic, mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, and vinegar in the jar of a blender.\
    \ Blend on high speed, scraping down as necessary, until smooth. With blender\
    \ running, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\
    \ Sauce will be quite loose at this point, but will thicken as it sits. Transfer\
    \ to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use."
  - '3. To Cook: Light 1 chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and
    covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal
    grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.
    Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting,
    cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.'
  - 4. Place chicken directly over the hot side of the grill, cover, and cook, rotating
    the pieces occasionally (but not flipping them), until the chicken is almost completely
    cooked through and only a few pink spots remain on the top side, about 4 minutes.
    Flip chicken and cook on second side until just done, about 30 seconds. Transfer
    to a large plate.
  - '5. To Assemble: Place buns cut side down over the hot side of the grill and cook,
    moving and rotating them occasionally, until well toasted and starting to char,
    about 1 minute. Transfer to a large cutting board. Use a fork to mash half an
    avocado on each bottom bun. Sprinkle with a little salt. Top with red onions,
    lettuce, and 2 pieces of chicken each. Spread top buns with sauce and close sandwiches.
    Serve immediately, with any extra green sauce on the side.'

  directions:
  - 1. Place beans in a large bowl and add 1 gallon water. Stir in two tablespoons
    kosher salt. Set aside at room temperature and let rest overnight. The next day,
    drain and rinse beans. Transfer to a large Dutch oven. Add bay leaf, split onion,
    and 3 quarts water. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a bare simmer, cover,
    and cook until beans are completely tender and skins are loose, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
    Discard onion and bay leaves. Drain beans, reserving liquid. (See note for pressure
    cooker or canned bean variations).
  - "2. Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering.\
    \ Add onions, garlic, and jalape\xF1o (if using) and cook, stirring frequently,\
    \ until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add beans and chipotle (if\

    \ is reached, adding extra cooking liquid as necessary to loosen to desired texture.\
    \ If smoother texture is required, use a hand blender or a food processor to process\

  directions:
  - "1. Preheat oven to 400\xB0F (200\xB0C). In a medium pot of salted boiling water,\
    \ cook elbow macaroni until just shy of al dente, about 2 minutes less than cooking\
    \ time indicated on package. Drain, then transfer pasta to a large mixing bowl\
    \ and toss with 2 tablespoons (30g) butter until butter is melted and pasta is\
    \ evenly coated. Set aside."
  - 2. In a large saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons (30g) butter over medium-high heat
    (do not allow it to brown). Add flour and whisk to form a paste. Continue to cook,
    stirring, until raw flour scent is gone, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly,
    add milk in a thin, steady stream, whisking constantly and thoroughly and getting
    into all corners of the pan to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially
    become very thick, then get very thin once all the milk is added.
  - 3. Heat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly.
    Reduce heat to medium-low and, working in increments, whisk in cheddar cheese
    until a smooth, emulsified cheese sauce forms; do not let sauce come to a boil
    once cheese is added. Whisk in hot sauce, mustard powder, and garlic powder. Season
    with salt if necessary.
  - "4. Scrape cheese sauce into pasta and mix until evenly coated. Let cool slightly,\
    \ then add grated Gruy\xE8re and mix well. Scrape pasta into a 9- by 13-inch baking\
    \ dish and smooth surface into an even layer."
  - 5. Add panko to a small mixing bowl. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons (45g) butter,
    then add to panko and mix until evenly coated. Season with salt. Scatter panko
    all over surface of mac and cheese in an even layer. Bake on top rack of oven
    until browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes (ovens can vary; check often to prevent
    top from burning).
  - 6. Let mac and cheese rest 15 minutes, then serve. Leftover mac and cheese can
    be refrigerated for up to 5 days; it reheats surprisingly well in the microwave
    or oven.

  directions:
  - Melt 3 tablespoons butter (or heat olive oil) in a large non-stick or cast iron
    skillet over medium heat. Add cipollini onions, season well with salt and pepper,
    reduce heat to low, and cook, turning occasionally, until onions are a deep, caramel
    brown, about 45 minutes total.
  - Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add beans and cook until
    tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. Drain and run under cool running water until at
    cold. Set aside.
  - Heat oil in a large saucepan over high heat until lightly smoking. Add mushrooms
    and cook, stirring occasionally, until they've released all their liquid and are
    browned, about 10 minutes total, reducing heat if oil starts to smoke excessively.
    Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add shallots, garlic, thyme, and remaining
    tablespoon butter (or olive oil) and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30
    seconds. Add soy sauce and toss to combine.
  - Add green beans, onions, and lemon juice to mushrooms and toss to reheat and combine.

  - Transfer to your blender (or use an immersion blender) and blend until smooth.
  - "That\u2019s it!"
  - WAYS TO USE THIS HOMEMADE ENCHILADA SAUCE
  - Recipes That Use Enchilada Sauce. Use your sauce in this Crock Pot Mexican Casserole,
    Vegetarian Enchiladas with Butternut Squash and Black Beans, and all of these
    other delicious recipes.
  - With Quesadillas. Add a drizzle of this sauce on top of a Freezer Breakfast Quesadilla
    or any quesadillas you like to make. It would also be tasty over these Breakfast
    Tacos.
  - With Pasta. Stir this sauce in with some cooked pasta and your favorite enchilada
    ingredients (black beans, ground meat, avocado, and melted cheese would all be
    tasty!). If this sounds delicious, check out my Taco Pasta for a similar dish.
  - Storage Tips
  - To Store. Refrigerate leftover sauce in an airtight storage container or jar for
    up to 1 week.
  - To Reheat. Gently rewarm sauce in a saucepan on the stovetop over medium-low heat.
  - To Freeze. Portion the sauce into individual containers and freeze for up to 3
    months. Let thaw overnight or (if you are in a big hurry) reheat gently in the
    microwave or on the stove.
  - Recommended Tools to Make this Recipe
  - Immersion Blender. An easy way to make smooth enchilada sauce.
  - Mason Jars. Both this smaller size and larger size would be great for storing
    and freezing leftover sauce. This option is great if you want to stock up on these
    jars.
  - Small Whisk. The perfect size for mixing sauce ingredients without splashing everywhere.
  - In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stir together the tomato sauce, chipotle
    peppers, adobo sauce, garlic powder, water or broth, salt, pepper, and coconut
    sugar.
  - Bring to a steady simmer, then reduce the heat to medium low. Cover the pan and
    let simmer gently until thickened, about 5 to 10 minutes.
  - "Transfer to a blender or food processor and blend until very smooth. Tip: Place\
    \ a thick layer of paper towels over the top of your blender before you turn it\
    \ on. Hot liquids in blenders love to splatter\u2014don\u2019t ask me how I know.\
    \ Taste and adjust seasoning as desired."

  ingredients:
  - 2 cans tomato sauce (15 ounce cans)
  - 1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce use two individual peppers for a spicy sauce
    or one if you prefer medium heat; if you like mild, try omitting the peppers and
    adding just a few teaspoons of the adobo sauce to begin; you can always add more
    sauce later for additional heat
  - 1 tablespoon adobo sauce from the can of chipotle peppers in adobo

  directions:
  - Shake together all sauce ingredients and set aside.
  - Slice the flank steak against the grain into 1/4 inch thick slices.
  - Working in two batches, toss the steak in the cornstarch and allow it to sit for
    10 minutes.
  - Heat 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. I preferred
    my ceramic non-stick pan over a stainless steel skillet.
  - Working in 3 batches, cook the beef for 2 minutes per side, or until lightly browned.
    Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate while you work on the other batches.
  - After all the beef is cooked, carefully wipe excess oil from the pan with a paper
    towel. Pour the sauce into the pan, return the beef and simmer for 1-2 minutes,
    until thickened.
  - Scatter green onions over the beef and enjoy.
  - Meal Prep
  - To serve as a meal prep lunch, cook the broccoli for 5-7 minutes in the pan before
    cooking the beef.
  - Divide the rice, broccoli and Mongolian beef between four 2-cup capacity storage
    containers.
  - Storage- store in the fridge for up to 4 days.
  - Reheat- heat in the microwave until steaming hot.

  directions:
  - "Combine everything except for the orange blossom water in a 2-quart stainless\
    \ steel saucier. Make note of the filled saucier's weight at this stage so the\
    \ reduction can be tracked on the scale. Pur\xE9e thick skinned or fibrous fruit\
    \ with an immersion blender, or mash tender fruit with a fork or metal spatula\
    \ until swimming in juice."
  - Place over medium heat and bring to a boil, continuously stirring and scraping
    along the bottom and sides of the saucier with a flexible, heat-resistant spatula.
    This should take no longer than 5 minutes; if it seems to be moving too slowly,
    simply increase the heat.
  - Once the mixture begins to boil, continue cooking until reduced by 4 ounces for
    a thin, saucy ribbon or 5 ounces for a thick, gooey ribbon. This phase should
    take about 6 minutes; while it's natural for the timing to vary from one stovetop
    to the next, a significant delay may indicate the heat is too low.
  - "Strain the syrup into a heat-safe container and stir in the orange blossom water.\
    \ If desired, season with an additional pinch of salt, bearing in mind the syrup\
    \ will seem less sweet when frozen. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than\
    \ 40\xB0F (4\xB0C)."

  directions:
  - We want to keep our baby bok choy somewhat intact, so the first thing we want
    to do is either halve or quarter each stalk (depending on the size of the bok
    choy) and wash under cold running water.
  - "Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat and add the oil. Swirl to coat\
    \ the entire surface of the pan. As soon as the oil is hot, add the garlic and\
    \ the shallots, and saut\xE8 for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously."
  - Add the bok choy, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Toss and cover. Cook for approximately
    2 minutes before uncovering, tossing, and covering. Continue to cook the bok choy
    until white parts reach desired doneness (I have found that this varies from person
    to person as some people prefer crunchier bok choy, while others prefer a more
    well-done stir-fry).
  - Sprinkle with crushed red pepper, if using, and drizzle with additional sesame
    oil, if desired.

  directions:
  - In a small bowl, mix together all dressing ingredients. Stir until completely
    combined and set aside in refrigerator.
  - Remove the meat from the refrigerator 1 hour before grilling. This will allow
    meat to be brought to room temp.
  - Heat your grill on high for 10 minutes. While the grill is heating, pat dry your
    your meat dry with a paper towel and generously salt and pepper.
  - Place your meat on the hot grill and allow to cook without moving for 4 minutes.
    Turn and cook for 3-4 more minutes and remove. Allow to rest under tented foil
    for 10 minutes.
  - While your meat is resting, brush your lettuce, avocado and onions with olive
    oil and sprinkle with salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low and place all the vegetables
    on the grill, oiled side down. Brush the opposite side with oil. Once charring
    begins the vegetables are ready to turn. (About 2-4 minutes). Turn the lettuce
    and onions over and remove the avocado. Continue cooking until opposite side has
    some charring.
  - While still warm, roughly chop the lettuce and slice the avocado. Then, separate
    onion rings.
  - On a large platter arrange the lettuce, onions, avocado, halved tomatoes and sliced
    steak.
  - Drizzle dressing over the top and sprinkle with extra blue cheese and chives.

  directions:
  - 1. Process tomatoes and their juice through food mill, pulse in food processor
    until pureed, or puree with hand blender. Puree should not be completely smooth,
    but should have no chunks larger than 1/16 of an inch. Set tomatoes aside.
  - 2. Combine butter and oil in medium saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until
    butter is melted. Add garlic, oregano, pepper flakes, and large pinch salt and
    cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add
    tomatoes, basil sprigs, onion halves, and sugar. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat
    to lowest setting (bubbles should barely be breaking the surface), and cook, stirring
    occasionally, until reduced by 1/2, about 1 hour. Discard onions and basil stems.
    Season to taste with salt. Allow to cool and store in covered container in the
    refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

  - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  - "Add hummus, hot sauce, garlic, parsley, and cheese to a food processor, and blend\
    \ until smooth. Pulse in chickpeas until the mixture is chunky and the chickpeas\
    \ have broken down a little (you\u2019ll still want a little texture here)."
  - Pour dip into a baking dish of your choosing (I have small crocks that I love),
    and bake 20-30 minutes, or until the dip is nice and hot.*

  directions:
  - "Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375\xB0F (190\xB0C).\
    \ In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil with minced garlic and\
    \ whisk for 30 seconds. Transfer to a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl\
    \ and press with the back of a spoon to extract as much oil as possible, leaving\
    \ garlic behind. Reserve pressed garlic separately. Add bread cubes to garlic\
    \ oil and toss to coat. Add 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, season to taste with\
    \ salt and pepper, and toss again. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until\
    \ croutons are pale golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven\
    \ and toss with 2 more tablespoons Parmesan. Allow to cool."
  - While croutons bake, make the dressing. Combine egg yolk, lemon juice, anchovies,
    Worcestershire sauce, pressed garlic, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the bottom
    of a cup that just fits the head of an immersion blender or in the bottom of a
    food processor. With blender or processor running, slowly drizzle in canola oil
    until a smooth emulsion forms. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl. Whisking constantly,
    slowly drizzle in remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil. Season to taste
    generously with salt and pepper.
  - To serve, toss lettuce with a few tablespoons of dressing, adding more if desired.
    Once lettuce is coated, add half of remaining cheese and three-quarters of croutons
    and toss again. Transfer to a salad bowl and sprinkle with remaining cheese and
    croutons. Serve.

  directions:
  - 'For the onions:'
  - Soak the onions in milk for about 5 - 10 minutes.
  - In the mean time, whisk together the flour, salt and pepper in a bowl. When the
    onions are soaked coat them in the flour mixture.
  - Heat about 1/2 an inch of oil in a deep skillet, over medium-high heat. When hot
    fry the onions in batches until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on a plate
    covered with paper towel.
  - 'For the green beans:'
  - Bring a pot of water to a boil, and boil the green beans for just 5 minutes. Drain
    and rinse with very cold water and set aside. The cold water helps keeps the bean
    bright green and pretty.
  - "Heat vegan butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, salt\
    \ and pepper and saut\xE9 for about 5 minutes until the mushrooms have shrunken\
    \ and mushroom juices appear. Add garlic and nutmeg and cook for another minute."
  - Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms, stir and cook for another minute. Stir in the
    vegetable broth, coconut milk, and non-dairy milk. Cook for about 10 minutes until
    sauce has thickened to a creamy consistency that sticks tothe back of a spoon.
    Add in the green beans and heat through.
  - Top with onions and serve hot.
  - In a medium sauce pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Toss in the carrots,
    agave and brown sugar. Cover and let cook for 10 - 15 minutes giving them a stir
    every now and then, until carrots are fork tender. Add the thyme and lemon juice,
    stir to combine, and serve.
  - Cover the potatoes with water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20
    until they are fork tender.
  - In the meantime, in a medium saucepan, combine the garlic, non-dairy milk and
    coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.
  - When your potatoes are cooked, drain, and return the potatoes to the pot. Mash
    and add about half of the garlic and milk mixture to the potatoes. Mix and add
    the remainder of the mixture until you reach the constancy you like. If you use
    all of the garlic and milk mixture and you would still like the potatoes softer,
    just add more coconut milk or non-dairy milk. Season with salt and serve.
  - Add all of the ingredients to a medium sauce pan. Bring to a simmer and cook for
    10-15 minutes, until the cranberries have popped and it looks all saucy and delicious.
    It will be thin, but will thicken as it cools.
  - Preheat your oven to 425F (220C).
  - Toss the Brussel sprouts with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and salt.
  - Spread on a baking sheet and bake for about 15 minutes until Brussel sprouts are
    cooked, and some bits are almost charred.
  - Preheat oven to 425F (220C).
  - In a medium bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Use a pastry cutter
    or a couple of forks to cut the butter into the flour until all the butter is
    mixed and the flour looks like fine crumbs. Pour in milk and stir until the dough
    just holds together. Don't over mix!
  - Lightly flour a clean surface and dump the dough on to the flour. Use your hands
    to pat the dough together and flatten until you make a disk that is about 2 inches
    deep. Don't use a rolling pin, you want to do this by hand. Use a biscuit cutter,
    an upside-down glass, or a cleaned tin can to cut out 8 biscuits, using up all
    the dough.
  - Bake for 10 - 15 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.
  - "In a medium sauce pan melt the vegan butter over medium heat. Saut\xE9 the onion\
    \ in the butter until the onion is caramelized. If you're in a rush, you can do\
    \ this quickly, but the slower you go, the more rich the flavour will become."
  - Mix in flour and cook for 1 minute. Now whisk in the broth and cook until the
    gravy thickens. Add soy sauce or tamari to taste if needed, this will also make
    the colour a richer brown.
  - Preheat your oven to 400F (200C). Toast bread for about 10 minutes until it starts
    to brown. Check it to make sure it doesn't burn! Remove from oven and set aside.
  - Toast bread for about 10 minutes until it starts to brown. Check it to make sure
    it doesn't burn! Remove from oven and set aside.
  - Reduce oven temperature to 350F (180C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.
  - "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium high heat and saut\xE9 the onions,\
    \ celery, and apples until they begin to caramelize. Add in the garlic, sage,\
    \ thyme, salt and pepper and saut\xE9 1-2 minutes more until fragrant, then remove\
    \ from heat."
  - Stir in the bread cubes and 2 cups broth. Add more broth as needed until bread
    is softened but not soggy. Spread the stuffing into the casserole dish, cover
    with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 10-15 minutes
    until top is browned.

  directions:
  - Mix dough, salt, and 3/4th of the water together in a bowl with a wooden spoon.
  - The dough should be play dough like and if it sticks to your hands add more flour.  If
    the dough is dry and cracking add more water.
  - Portion out the dough into 40 gram balls about 2 tbsps of golf ball size dough
    and roll with hands until round
  - Using two piece of parchment paper use a skillet to press the dough flat into
    a tortilla or use a tortilla press.
  - Pre-heat over medium-high heat a non-stick skillet.  Using no oil add your tortilla
    for 30-60 seconds and flip.  You should have specked brown spots on the tortilla
    if not adjust heat accordingly.

  directions:
  - To make the Thai meatballs, mix all meatball ingredients (leave out canola oil)
    together until fully incorporated. If available use a stand mixer set on medium
    speed with the flat beater attachment. Heat oil in a large skillet or frying pan
    over medium heat. Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon scoop meatballs out in 2
    tbsp portions. Using your hands, gently roll and place the meatball in the oil.
    Brown the meatballs in batches of 10 on all sides, but do not cook all the way
    through. Place meatballs on a plate and set aside.
  - "To make the red curry sauce, drain off all but 1 tbsp oil from the pan. Add the\
    \ onions and saut\xE9 until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saut\xE9 2 minutes\
    \ longer. Add the Thai red curry paste and break it up as much as possible followed\
    \ by the coconut milk and stir or whisk until paste and cream are fully incorporated\
    \ and curry sauce is smooth. When your red curry sauce base is smooth, add the\
    \ lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and salt if using. Bring to a boil and add all\
    \ the meatballs back into the Thai red curry sauce. Turn heat to a simmer, cover\
    \ the pan with a lid. Simmer meatballs for 20 minutes until the sauce has thickened\
    \ and the meatballs are cooked through the center. Add fresh basil and stir to\
    \ combine."
  - Serve over your choice of rice or roasted veggies, with cilantro and crushed red
    pepper flakes for additional heat.

  directions:
  - 'Use a two-piece circular pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly,
    then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. '
  - '3. For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter,
    and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season
    to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer
    along the bottom of the pan.'
  - "4. For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat\
    \ to 450\xB0F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract,\
    \ salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle\
    \ attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined,\
    \ then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture\
    \ is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl\
    \ and beater with a flexible spatula."
  - 5. Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well
    combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over
    the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any
    clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until
    well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.
  - 6. In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing
    on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds
    more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in
    mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the
    batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter
    to room temperature before baking.
  - '7. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon
    across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through.
    If you don''t see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up,
    keep bouncing the spoon until they''re gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed
    and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake
    will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening
    its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. '
  - "8. Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close\
    \ the door and set the oven to 250\xB0F. Continue baking until the outer edge\
    \ of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble\
    \ quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should\
    \ be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center\
    \ registers 145\xB0F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches.\
    \ Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking\
    \ is the result of over-baking and nothing more."
  - 9. Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula
    around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue
    letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering
    it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours.
  - '10. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of
    the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan
    on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough
    to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable
    base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer
    ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it
    from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat
    serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.'
  - '11. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of
    the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake
    in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan
    works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then
    invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide
    free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes
    more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert
    the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until
    needed, up to 10 days.'
  - '12. To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large
    bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and
    glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef''s knife dipped in
    hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade
    under hot running water between each slice. Top with spoonfuls of the sauced fruit,
    if using, or other toppings and sauces as desired.'

  directions:
  - "1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450\xB0F/230\xB0C\
    \ (or 400\xB0F/200\xB0C if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large\
    \ pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce;\
    \ 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer,\
    \ and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk,\
    \ about 10 minutes after returning to a boil."
  - 2. Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic,
    and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat.
    Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden,
    about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a
    large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.
  - "3. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for\
    \ about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with\
    \ infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to\
    \ coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato\u2013like paste\
    \ has built up on the potato chunks."
  - 4. Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading
    them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using
    a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn
    potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over,
    turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.
  - 5. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced
    parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

  directions:
  - 1. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered
    with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate.
    Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively,
    set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat
    for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.
  - 2. Whisk together garlic, rosemary, lemon juice, and olive oil in a large bowl.
    Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer half of mixture to a separate container
    and set aside. Add chicken to the large bowl and turn pieces to thoroughly coat.
  - 3. Place chicken directly over the hot side of the grill, cover, and cook, rotating
    the pieces occasionally (but not flipping them), until the chicken is almost completely

  directions:
  - In a medium saucepan of boiling salted water, cook penne until just short of al
    dente, about 1 minute less than the package recommends.  When finished drain and
    keep 1 cup of pasta water.
  - Brown ground beef in separate pan and sit aside.
  - Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine oil, garlic, and pepper flakes. Cook over
    medium low heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes.
  - 'Add tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer. '
  - When pasta is ready, transfer it to sauce and add ground beef.
  - 'Add about 1/4 cup pasta water to sauce and increase heat to bring pasta and sauce
    to a vigorous simmer. '
  - 'Cook, stirring and shaking the pan and adding more pasta water as necessary to
    keep sauce loose, until pasta is perfectly al dente, 1 to 2 minutes longer.  Adding
    extra olive oil to coat the pasta if desired stirring well to emulsify. '
  - 'Continue cooking pasta until sauce thickens and begins to coat noodles, then
    remove from heat and toss in cheese and parsley, stirring vigorously to incorporate. '
  - Season with salt and serve right away with additional grated Parmesan.

  directions:
  - Add vegan cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, garlic, vegan parmesan cheese,
    salt, and pepper to a mixing bowl and mix thoroughly to combine.
  - Divide filling between two flour tortillas and spread into an even layer all the
    way to the edge. Top each with half of the fresh basil leaves (leaving one edge
    bare so the tortilla can stick to itself). Press basil down slightly to adhere.
  - Tightly roll up tortillas from one end to another, starting from the end with
    basil all the way to the edge, working toward the end that's slightly bare.
  - Once rolled up, squeeze gently to compact everything and lay seam-side down for
    slicing.
  - Use a serrated knife to gently cut tortillas into 1/2-inch slices. Between the
    two tortillas, you should have a total of 20-22 pinwheels (amount as original
    recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).
  - Arrange on a serving platter and serve immediately, or chill for up to 24 hours,
    covered in the fridge. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for 2-3
    days, though best when fresh.

  cook_time: 6 hours, plus overnight to soak beans
  created: '2021-01-24 01:57:32'
  description: ''
  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - 1. Place beans, 6 tablespoons kosher salt (or 3 tablespoons table salt), and water
    in a large plastic container or bowl. Allow to soak at room temperature at least
    8 hours, or overnight. Drain and rinse soaked beans.
  - 2. Add dried chilies to a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stockpot and cook
    over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with an intense,
    roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. Do not allow to smoke. Remove chilies, place in
    a small bowl, and set aside. Alternatively, place dried chilies on a microwave-safe
    plate and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until chilies are pliable
    and toasted-smelling, about 30 seconds total.
  - "3. Season short ribs on all sides with salt and pepper. Add oil to Dutch oven\
    \ and heat over high heat until smoking. Add half of short ribs and brown well\
    \ on all sides (it may be necessary to brown ribs in 3 batches, depending on size\
    \ of Dutch oven\u2014do not overcrowd pan), 8 to 12 minutes total, reducing heat\
    \ if fat begins to smoke excessively or meat begins to burn. Transfer to a large\
    \ rimmed baking sheet or plate. Repeat with remaining short ribs, browning them\
    \ in the fat remaining in Dutch oven. Once all short ribs are cooked, transfer\
    \ all rendered fat into a small bowl and reserve separately. Allow short ribs\
    \ to cool at room temperature."
  - "4. Meanwhile, return Dutch oven to medium-high heat and add 1 cup (240ml) chicken\
    \ broth, using a flat wooden spoon or stiff spatula to scrape browned bits off\
    \ of bottom of pan. Reduce heat until chicken broth is at a bare simmer, add toasted\
    \ chilies to liquid, and cook until chilies have softened and liquid is reduced\
    \ by half, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer chilies and liquid to a blender. Add anchovy,\
    \ Marmite, soy sauce, tomato paste, ground spices, coffee, and chocolate and blend\
    \ at high speed, scraping down sides as necessary, until a completely smooth pur\xE9\
    e has formed, about 2 minutes. Set chili pur\xE9e aside."
  - "5. Trim meat from short rib bones and hand-chop into rough 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch\
    \ pieces (finer or larger, as you prefer), reserving bones separately. Add any\
    \ accumulated meat juices to chili pur\xE9e."
  - "6. Heat 4 tablespoons (60ml) rendered beef fat (if necessary, add vegetable oil\
    \ to reach 4 tablespoons) in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stockpot over\
    \ medium heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until\
    \ softened but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add fresh chilies, garlic, and oregano\
    \ and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chili pur\xE9\
    e and cook, stirring frequently and scraping bottom of pot, until chili mixture\
    \ begins to fry and leaves a coating on bottom of pan, 2 to 4 minutes. Add chicken\
    \ stock, chopped beef, beef bones, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, scraping\
    \ bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Reduce heat to lowest possible setting,\
    \ add beans, and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans are almost tender,\
    \ about 1 hour. Add crushed tomatoes and cider vinegar and cook, with cover slightly\
    \ ajar, until beans and beef are fully tender and broth is rich and lightly thickened,\
    \ 2 to 3 1/2 hours longer, adding water if necessary to keep beans and meat mostly\
    \ submerged (a little protrusion is okay)."
  - 7. Using tongs, remove and discard bay leaves and bones. (At this point, any excess
    meat still attached to the bones can be removed, chopped, and added back to the
    chili, if desired.) Add vodka (or bourbon), hot sauce, and brown sugar and stir
    to combine. Season to taste with kosher salt, ground black pepper, and additional
    vinegar.
  - 8. Serve immediately, or, for best flavor, allow to cool and refrigerate overnight,
    or up to 1 week in a sealed container. Reheat and serve with desired garnishes.

  directions:
  - Season eggplant slices lightly on both sides with salt. Place double layer of
    paper towels or clean kitchen towel on large plate and lay single layer of eggplant
    slices on top. Top with 2 more layers paper towels or clean kitchen towel. Top
    with second large plate and place another layer of paper towels and eggplant on
    top. Top with third large plate. Microwave on high power until eggplant is easily
    compressed, about 3 minutes (be careful, plates will be hot).
  - Working one piece of eggplant at a time, press firmly between paper towels until
    compressed. Set aside on a large tray. Repeat microwaving and pressing steps until
    all eggplant slices are compressed.
  - Puree tomatoes and their juice in a food mill, blender, or food processor until
    no pieces larger than 1/16th of an inch remain. Heat olive oil and butter in a
    large saucepan over medium high heat until butter is melted. Add garlic, 2 teaspoons
    oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about
    2 minutes. Add tomatoes, onion, half of parsley, and half or basil, bring to a
    simmer, turn heat to low, and cook until reduced by half, about 1 hour. Stir in
    half of remaining parsley and basil and season to taste with salt. Remove the
    onion and discard. Set aside.
  - Place flour in one wide mixing bowl, eggs and 1 teaspoon salt in second wide mixing
    bowl, and breadcrumbs, remaining 2 teaspoons oregano, and 1/4 up parmesan in third
    bowl. Working with one slice at a time, dredge eggplant in flour, dip in egg,
    and coat in seasoned bread crumbs. Transfer breaded eggplant to rimmed baking
    sheet.
  - "Preheat oven to 375\xB0F and adjust oven rack to center position. Line clean\
    \ rimmed baking sheet with double layer of paper towels. In a 12-inch non-stick\
    \ or cast iron skillet, heat oil to 375\xB0F. Carefully slide 3-4 eggplant slices\
    \ into hot oil in single layer. Cook, shaking pan occasionally until first side\
    \ is golden brown and crisp, about 2 1/2 minutes. Using tongs, carefully flip\
    \ eggplant and continue cooking, stirring occasionally until second side is crisp,\
    \ about 1 1/2 minutes longer. Transfer slices to paper-towel lined baking sheet\
    \ and season immediately with salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant slices."
  - In a 9- by 13-inch glass baking dish, spread 1/4 of tomato sauce over bottom.
    Add 1/3 of eggplant slices in single layer (they may overlap a little bit). Press
    down to form even layer. Add 1/4 of tomato sauce and spread evenly. Evenly spread
    1/3 of mozzarella and 1/3 of remaining parmesan over sauce. Repeat with two more
    layers each of eggplant, sauce, and cheese, reserving 1/4 cup of parmesan at the
    end.
  - Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake until light golden
    brown and bubble on surface, about 20 minutes longer. Remove from oven and sprinkle
    remaining parmesan over the top. Allow to rest for fifteen minutes, sprinkle with
    remaining parsley and basil, and serve.

  - CHIPOTLE SAUCE
  - To make the dressing add all of the ingredients to a small bowl or jar and whisk
    until combined.
  - CHICKPEAS & SQUASH
  - "Preheat oven to 420\xB0F/ 215\xB0C."
  - Add the diced butternut squash and chickpeas to a medium sized bowl and pour the
    chipotle sauce over the top. Use a spoon to mix it all together until everything
    is evenly coated. Spread the squash chickpeas in a single layer out on a large
    baking sheet and place in the oven to roast for 35-40 minutes or until the squash
    is tender and caramelize on the outside. Halfway through roasting take turn the
    tray around in the oven and give everything a quick stir.
  - When the squash and chickpeas are almost done in the oven get the kale ready.
    Place the chopped kale in a big salad bowl. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil
    and sprinkle a small pinch of the sea salt over the kale and massage the leaves
    with your hands by lightly scrunching big handfuls at a time. This should take
    about 30 seconds before the leaves grow darker in color and fragrant.
  - After you have removed the squash and chickpeas from the oven, let cool for about
    5 minutes before adding to the kale. Top with the pepitas and toss everything
    to combine and enjoy.

  directions:
  - To prepare the potatoes, scrub them clean if dirty and rinse under running water.
    Remove and discard any nubby sprouting areas. Place the potatoes in a large Dutch
    oven or soup pot.
  - Fill the pot with water until the potatoes are submerged and covered by 1 inch
    of additional water. Add 1 tablespoon of the salt. Bring the mixture to a boil
    over medium-high heat and continue cooking until the potatoes are very easily
    pierced through by a fork (smaller potatoes are done around 20 minutes, and medium
    around 25 minutes).
  - "While the potatoes cook, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and drizzle\
    \ 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over a large, rimmed baking sheet. Brush the oil\
    \ so it\u2019s evenly distributed over the sheet."
  - When the potatoes are done, drain them in a large colander and let them cool for
    about 5 minutes, until they can be handled safely.
  - "Evenly distribute the potatoes over the prepared baking sheet, and use a potato\
    \ masher or a serving fork to gently smash each potato to a height of about \xBD\
    \ inch. (Thinner potatoes are more crispy.)"
  - "Drizzle the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the smashed potatoes. Sprinkle\
    \ the garlic powder, onion powder and remaining \xBC teaspoon salt over the potatoes.\
    \ Finally, sprinkle them lightly with freshly ground black pepper."
  - Bake until the potatoes are nice and golden on the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes.
    Sprinkle them with chopped fresh herbs, and serve hot.

  directions:
  - 'Prepare the dough: Measure the flour, water, olive oil, salt and yeast into a
    large mixing bowl. Mix together with your hand or a dough scraper until it forms
    a shaggy, sticky ball with no dry patches. Cover the bowl using a damp towel or
    plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for 5 minutes.'
  - Wet your hand, and reach down between the side of the bowl and the dough, as though
    you were going to lift the dough out, but instead of lifting, stretch the bottom
    of the dough up, and fold it over the top. Repeat three more times, turning the
    bowl 90 degrees each time. Cover the bowl again for 5 minutes, then repeat the
    folding-and-resting process three more times. After the fourth time, cover the
    bowl, and let the dough rest, undisturbed, for 40 minutes, then transfer the bowl
    to the fridge for at least 12 hours or up to 72 hours.
  - 'About 3 hours before you want to eat the pizza, get ready for assembly: Pour
    the olive oil into a well-seasoned 9- or 10-inch cast-iron skillet, and use your
    fingers to coat the inside of the pan, including the sides. Transfer the dough
    to the pan, and turn it once to coat both sides with the oil. After coating the
    dough in oil, press the dough to the edges of the pan, dimpling it with your fingertips.
    If the dough shrinks back, cover it and let it rest for about 15 minutes, then
    repeat the pressing and dimpling. At this point, you should be able to smush the
    dough out and into the edges of the pan, but if not, give it one more 15-minute
    rest before trying again. Cover the dough, and let it rise for 2 hours at room
    temperature. It will look soft and jiggle when you gently shake the pan.'
  - "Place one rack at the bottom of the oven and one toward the top (about 4 to 5\
    \ inches from the top heating element), then heat the oven to 450 degrees. When\
    \ you\u2019re ready to bake the pizza, sprinkle a scant 1 cup mozzarella evenly\
    \ over the crust. Cover the entire dough so none is showing, then dollop small\
    \ spoonfuls of the sauce over the cheese. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella on\
    \ top, and bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until the\
    \ cheese is bubbling and the bottom and edges of the crust are a rich golden brown.\
    \ (Use a spatula to check the bottom.) If the bottom is brown but the top still\
    \ seems pale, transfer the pizza to the top rack, and bake for 2 to 4 minutes\
    \ longer. On the other hand, if the top seems fine but the bottom\u2019s not browned\
    \ to your liking, leave the pizza on the bottom rack for another 2 to 4 minutes."
  - Remove the pizza from the oven, and place the pan on a heatproof surface. Carefully
    run a table knife or spatula between the edge of the pizza and side of the pan
    to prevent the cheese from sticking as it cools. Let the pizza cool very briefly;
    as soon as you feel comfortable doing so, carefully transfer it from the pan to
    a cooling rack or cutting surface. If garnishing with hard cheese and herbs, add
    those now. Serve the pizza anywhere from medium-hot to warm, and use kitchen shears
    or a large pair of scissors to cut it into wedges.

  directions:
  - 1. Cut the roasting chicken into pieces. Divide it into two thighs, two drums,
    two wings and two breasts.
  - 2. In a large saucepan over a medium heat, melt the cooking fat. Once melted,
    add in the chicken pieces and cook until golden brown on all sides. Remove the
    chicken and put aside until later.
  - 3. Add the onions to the same saucepan and cook in the remaining juices. Once
    they have sauteed and begun to brown, add the garlic and cook for a few minutes
    together.
  - 4. If you wish to add a thickening paleo flour, do so now.
  - 5. Whisk in the chicken broth. At this point you will be able to tell if the stew
    is too thick. If so, feel free to add more broth or stock, or even just water.
    Do so slowly while continuing to mix.
  - 6. Add in the vegetables and chicken, along with any juices from where the chicken
    was resting.
  - 7. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  - 8. Allow the stew to come to a simmer, and then cook on low, but still maintain
    the simmer.
  - 9. Cover and cook for approximately 30 minutes.
  - 10. Stir in the cream or coconut milk, green onions and peas.
  - 11. Cook for just about another 2 minutes and serve.

  directions:
  - Rinse ribs and dry COMPLETELY with paper towels.
  - Douse dry ribs with liquid smoke if using and rub it in.
  - Lightly coat ribs in olive oil.
  - Mix together seasoning and sprinkle generously over ribs, front and back. (You
    don't have to use all of seasoning mix)
  - Massage the spices into the ribs, adding more olive oil to help distribute the
    spices well if needed.
  - Place the ribs in a large ziplock bag or covered bowl and marinate in the fridge
    for 1-2 hours.
  - Preheat the oven to 250 F.
  - Place the ribs on a foil lined baking tray in a single layer.
  - Add another piece of foil on top to create a pouch for the ribs to cook in. Be
    sure to seal the edges of the foil so that it's tight and steam won't seep out.
  - Bake on the middle rack of 3 1/2 -4 hours. (Mine only needed 3 1/2 hours) Check
    on it after the 3 1/2 hour mark. The oven temperature is very low so you can afford
    to cook it a bit longer without worry)
  - When the ribs are done to your liking, drain off the excess fat.
  - Brush the ribs with desired amount of BBQ sauce.
  - Broil on low until the sauce is sticky. (this won't take long so keep an eye on
    it)
  - Serve hot and enjoy!!

    onions and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened but no
    browned, about 6 minutes. Add ground spices and oregano and continue to cook,
    stirring frequently, until aromatic, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add tomato paste, soy
    sauce, anchovy, Marmite (if using), and sugar, and cook, stirring frequently until
    paste begins to stick to bottom of pan, about 1 1/2 minutes.
  - 3. Remove pan from heat and add 2 cups of chicken broth. Scrape up any browned
    bits from bottom of pan with wooden spoon. Add ground beef and break up using
    whisk until mixture is completely homogeneous (no large chunks of beef should
    remain). Add remaining chicken stock and return to stovetop and set over medium
    high heat. Cook, whisking frequently, until mixture comes to a simmer. Cover with
    lid slightly ajar, reduce heat to low, and cook for 75 minutes, stirring occasionally,
    until mixture is thick and intense.
  - 4. Combine masa harina and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl and mix until homogeneous.
    Add masa mixture, hot sauce, and bourbon to chili and stir to combine. Bring to
    a boil and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt
    and serve immediately on top of burgers, hot dogs, or fries.

  directions:
  - "1. Preheat the oven to 425\xB0F (225\xB0C)."
  - 2. Set a stovetop steamer over medium heat. Add the potatoes. Adjust the heat
    to maintain a gentle simmer and steam the potatoes until tender when pierced with
    a cake tester, about 10 minutes.
  - "3. Meanwhile, halve the onion through the root end so that there is a piece of\
    \ core at the end of both halves holding the layers together. Cut off a small\
    \ slice at one end of each lemon so that you just expose the inner fruit. Use\
    \ a mandoline or sharp chef\u2019s knife to thinly slice the onion and lemons,\
    \ discarding the uncut end of the lemon, any seeds, and onion cores when you are\
    \ done. Mix them together with your hands in a medium bowl and season with salt\
    \ to taste."
  - 4. Once the potatoes are cooked, transfer them to a large plate to cool slightly
    and then use a paring knife to peel off the skins and discard. Cut each potato
    in half.
  - "5. Put the olive oil in a heavy 9 \xD7 13-inch (23 \xD7 33 cm) roasting pan and\
    \ rub it around the inside of the pan to coat it thoroughly. Layer the onions\
    \ and lemons in the bottom of the dish. Lay the potatoes cut side down on top\
    \ of them. Thinly slice the butter and lay one slice over each potato and scatter\
    \ any extra over the top. Bake for 25 minutes. Rotate the dish and bake until\
    \ the potatoes are a deep golden brown, about 10 more minutes."
  - 6. Remove the dish from the oven and scatter the rosemary over the potatoes. Let
    the dish rest for 5 minutes before serving so that the herb can permeate the dish.
    Serve from the roasting pan so the potatoes will remain crisp.

  difficulty: Easy
  directions:
  - 1. Parboil the potatoes in salted water for about 3-4 minutes, no longer.
  - 2. Meanwhile in a 375 degree F oven, heat a baking pan of sufficient size to hold
    your potatoes without crowding them. A glass or metal pan is fine, as long as
    it is well heated beforehand. This will help to prevent the potatoes from sticking
    to the pan.
  - 3. After parboiling, drain the potatoes and let them stand for 5 minutes. Then
    toss the potatoes with the lemon juice.
  - 4. Toss together so that the potatoes absorb the lemon juice.
  - 5. Add the salt, pepper, herbs, garlic cloves and olive oil.
  - 6. Transfer the seasoned potatoes, garlic and oil to the hot baking pan. These
    should sizzle as they hit the pan; a good indication that they will not stick.
    Roast the potatoes for about 60-75 minutes or until they are nicely golden brown
    all over, turning them every 20 minutes or so. After the first 10 minutes, give
    the pan a shake to make sure the potatoes are not stuck to it. The roasted garlic
    may have to be removed before the potatoes are finished as it generally cooks
    faster.

  directions:
  - 1. Adjust broiler rack to 8 inches below element and preheat broiler to high.
    Place poblanos, onion, tomatillos, serranos, and garlic on a foil-lined rimmed
    baking sheet. Place under broiler and broil, turning vegetables occasionally,
    until tomatillos are completely softened and lightly charred, about 10 minutes.
    Transfer tomatillos to a bowl. Continue broiling until poblanos are charred on
    all sides, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a separate bowl and cover tightly
    with foil. Continue broiling until onion, Serranos, and garlic are softened and
    charred, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to bowl with tomatillos along with any
    juices and set aside.
  - "2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and set oven to 375\xB0F. Add chicken\
    \ stock to bowl with poblanos and peel poblanos while submerged in stock. Transfer\
    \ flesh to bowl with tomatillos, leaving skin and seeds with the stock. Strain\
    \ the stock through a fine mesh strainer into the bowl with the tomatillo/pepper\
    \ mixture. Discard skins and seeds. Add cilantro to mixture. Set mixture aside."
  - 3. Season chicken pieces on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large
    Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add chicken skin side-down and cook
    without moving until well browned on first side, about 6 minutes. Flip chicken
    and continue cooking until lightly browned on second side, about 2 minutes longer.
    Transfer chicken to a bowl and pour off excess fat from Dutch oven, reserving
    any brown liquid.
  - 4. Add tomatillo/pepper mixture to the Dutch oven and scrape up any browned bits
    from the bottom. Using an immersion blender, puree mixture into a chunky sauce.
    Season to taste with salt and pepper. Return chicken to pot, bring to a simmer,
    cover with lid slightly ajar, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about
    15 minutes. Meanwhile, wrap tortillas in aluminum foil and place in oven to warm.
  - 5. When chicken is cooked, remove from heat and transfer chicken to a large bowl
    using tongs. Allow to rest until cool enough to handle. Shred chicken into thin
    strips, discarding skin and bones. Add 1 cup of sauce, half of cheese, and half
    of Mexican crema to chicken and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and
    pepper.
  - 6. Remove tortillas from oven and unwrap. Spread 1/3 of the remaining sauce in
    the bottom of a 13- by 9-inch casserole dish. Dip each tortilla in the remaining
    sauce and stack on a cutting board. Working one tortilla at at time, place 2 tablespoons
    of chicken filling in a line down the center and roll up tightly. Place in the
    casserole dish seam side-down. Continue until all the tortillas and filling are
    used (the casserole will be tightly packed).
  - 7. Spread remaining sauce on top of enchiladas and lay the remaining cheese down
    in a line through the middle of each row of enchiladas. Cover tightly with aluminum
    foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until cheese is
    lightly browned and bubbly, about 10 minutes longer.
  - 8. Remove enchiladas from oven, drizzle with remaining crema, sprinkle with chopped
    cilantro, and serve immediately.

  directions:
  - '1. Make the Cole Slaw: In a large bowl, combine the vinegar, mayonnaise, salt,
    celery seed, dry mustard, and black pepper. Stir until combined. Add the cabbage,
    and mix until it is evenly coated in the dressing. Set aside.'
  - '2. Cook the Hot Dogs: Pour 1/2 cup water into a large skillet set over medium
    heat. Add the hot dogs. Cook until the hot dogs are thoroughly warmed. If the
    water has not evaporated, pour any remaining water off. Add one tablespoon of
    butter. When it has melted, roll the hot dogs around until they are coated in
    the butter. Cook until the hot dogs are lightly browned on both sides, about 6
    minutes total. Remove and set aside.'
  - 3. Add remaining butter to the skillet, then add the buns, cut-side down. Cook
    until browned, about 1 minute. Rotate the buns. Continue this process until the
    buns are lightly browned on four sides, about 4 minutes total.
  - 4. To serve, place one hot dog in each bun. Top all of them with mustard and a
    few spoonfuls of the slaw. Serve immediately.

  - 2. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, rum, orange
    zest, vanilla extract, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and star anise (if using) until
    thoroughly combined. Add milk and whisk to blend.

  - 4. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium
    heat, swirling skillet, until foaming subsides. Meanwhile, soak 2 to 3 slices
    of bread in egg bath, turning, until saturated. Add soaked bread to skillet and
    cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle
    top side of bread with sugar, flip, and continue to cook, swirling occasionally,
    until browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer French toast to
    rack in oven in a single layer to keep warm and repeat with remaining slices of
    bread and egg bath. Allow each batch of French toast to heat in oven for at least
    10 minutes (but not more than 30) to ensure it is fully cooked through.

  directions:
  - In a small bowl, mix together all dressing ingredients. Stir until completely
    combined and set aside in refrigerator.
  - Remove the meat from the refrigerator 1 hour before grilling. This will allow
    meat to be brought to room temp.
  - Heat your grill on high for 10 minutes. While the grill is heating, pat dry your
    your meat dry with a paper towel and generously salt and pepper.
  - Place your meat on the hot grill and allow to cook without moving for 4 minutes.
    Turn and cook for 3-4 more minutes and remove. Allow to rest under tented foil
    for 10 minutes.
  - While your meat is resting, brush your lettuce, avocado and onions with olive
    oil and sprinkle with salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low and place all the vegetables
    on the grill, oiled side down. Brush the opposite side with oil. Once charring
    begins the vegetables are ready to turn. (About 2-4 minutes). Turn the lettuce
    and onions over and remove the avocado. Continue cooking until opposite side has
    some charring.
  - While still warm, roughly chop the lettuce and slice the avocado. Then, separate
    onion rings.
  - On a large platter arrange the lettuce, onions, avocado, halved tomatoes and sliced
    steak.
  - Drizzle dressing over the top and sprinkle with extra blue cheese and chives.

  description: ''
  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - 1. Combine flour, salt, yeast, water, and oil in a large bowl. Mix with hands
    or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains. (The bowl should be at least 4 to
    6 times the volume of the dough to account for rising.)
  - "2. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, making sure that the edges are well\
    \ sealed, then let rest at cool room temperature (no warmer than 75\xB0F) for\
    \ at least 8 hours and up to 24. Dough should rise dramatically and fill bowl.\
    \ In a hot kitchen, the dough may overproof near the end of that range."
  - 3. Sprinkle top of dough lightly with flour, then transfer it to a well-floured
    work surface. Divide dough into 2 pieces and form each into a ball by holding
    it with well-floured hands and tucking the dough underneath itself, rotating it
    until it forms a tight ball.
  - "4. Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons oil in the bottom of two 10-inch cast iron skillets\
    \ or round cake pans (see note). Place 1 ball of dough in each pan and turn to\
    \ coat evenly with oil. Using a flat palm, press dough around the pan, flattening\
    \ it slightly and spreading oil around the entire bottom and edges of the pan.\
    \ Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough sit at room temperature for 2\
    \ hours (at room temperatures above 75\xB0F, the dough may require less time to\
    \ rise; at temperatures below 65\xB0F/18\xB0C deg;F, it may require more time).\
    \ After the first hour, adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat\
    \ oven to 550\xB0F (290\xB0C)."
  - 5. After 2 hours, dough should be mostly filling the pan up to the edges. Use
    your fingertips to press it around until it fills in every corner, popping any
    large bubbles that appear. Lift up one edge of the dough to let any air bubbles
    underneath escape, then repeat, moving around the dough until there are no air
    bubbles left underneath and the dough is evenly spread around the pan.
  - 6. Top each round of dough with 3/4 cup sauce, spreading sauce to the very edge
    with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella cheese, all the way
    to the edges. Season with salt. Add other toppings as desired. Drizzle with olive
    oil and scatter a few basil leaves over the top of each pizza, if desired.
  - 7. Transfer pan to oven and bake until top is golden brown and bubbly and bottom
    is golden brown and crisp when you lift it with a thin spatula, 12 to 15 minutes.
    Immediately sprinkle with grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese, if using.
    Using a thin spatula, loosen pizza and peek underneath. If bottom is not as crisp
    as desired, place pan over a burner and cook on medium heat, moving the pan around
    to cook evenly until it is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove the pizzas and transfer
    to a cutting board. Cut each pizza into 6 slices and serve immediately.

  directions:
  - "1. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 275\xB0F. Add\
    \ dried chilies to large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stock pot and cook over\
    \ medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with intense,\
    \ roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. Do not allow to smoke. Remove chilies to small\
    \ bowl and set aside. Alternatively, place dried chilies on a microwave-safe plate\
    \ and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until pliable and toasted-smelling,\
    \ about 30 seconds total. Transfer to a 2-quart microwave-safe liquid measuring\
    \ cup or bowl. Add 2 cups chicken broth, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave\
    \ on high power until gently simmering, about 5 minutes. Remove from microwave\
    \ and set aside."
  - 2. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty Dutch oven over high heat until
    shimmering. Cook oxtails until well-browned on all sides, about 8 minutes total.
    Remove oxtails and set aside. Reduce heat to medium.
  - 3. Add remaining two tablespoons oil and heat along with onions and garlic and
    cook, stirring frequently, until deep brown and just starting to burn, about 10
    minutes. Add cumin, cloves, and oregano and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant,
    about 30 seconds. Add chipotle chilies, vinegar, and remaining chicken broth.
    Scrape up browned bits from bottom of pan, simmer until reduced by about half,
    then transfer entire contents to the jar of a blender.
  - 4. Add soaked chilies and their liquid to the blender along with fish sauce. Start
    blender on low and slowly increase speed to high. Puree until smooth, about 1
    minute. Set aside.
  - 5. Place beef chuck in Dutch oven. Add oxtails, bay leaves, and sauce. Bring to
    a boil over high heat. Place lid on pot slightly cracked, then transfer to oven.
    Cook, turning beef occasionally, until completely tender and a cake tester or
    metal skewer inserted into meat shows little to no resistance, about 4 hours.
    Discard bay leaves and oxtails (meat from oxtails can be eaten if desired). Transfer
    chuck to a large plate. Return Dutch oven to stovetop and cook, stirring frequently,
    over medium-high heat until liquid is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, about 5 minutes.
  - 6. Beef can be cut and served immediately, but for best flavor, transfer beef
    to a sealed container along with liquid and refrigerate up to five days. When
    ready to serve, slice beef against the grain into 1 1/2- to 2-inch slices, then
    shred into large chunks with fingers or two forks. Return beef to a pot along
    with the sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook, gently stirring and folding until
    beef is hot, tender, and coated in sauce. Season to taste with salt. Serve immediately,
    piling the beef into warm corn tortillas with onions, cilantro, salsa, limes,
    or other condiments as desired. Alternatively, serve as-is with rice, noodles,
    grits, or cornbread.

  directions:
  - "1. Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 300\xB0F (165\xB0C).\
    \ Place tomatoes in a large bowl. Using your hands, crush the tomatoes by squeezing\
    \ them in your fingers until pieces no larger than 1/2-inch remain. Transfer 3\
    \ cups of crushed tomatoes to a sealed container and reserve in the refrigerator\
    \ until step 4."
  - 2. Heat olive oil and butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven until butter
    is melted. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant but not
    browned, about 2 minutes. Add pepper flakes and oregano and cook, stirring, until
    fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, carrot, onion, and basil, and stir to
    combine. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over high heat.
  - 3. Cover Dutch oven with lid slightly ajar and transfer to oven. Cook, stirring
    once every 1 to 2 hours, until reduced by about half and darkened to a deep red,
    5 to 6 hours (reduce oven temperature if the sauce is bubbling too rapidly or
    the browned bits begin to turn too dark).
  - 4. Remove from oven. Using tongs, discard onion halves, carrots, and basil stems.
    Add reserved tomatoes to sauce and stir to combine. Add fish sauce, if using.
    Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in minced herbs along with additional
    olive oil as desired. Serve immediately, or allow to cool at room temperature,
    transfer to airtight containers, and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Sauce can also
    be frozen in sealed containers for up to 6 months. To reheat, warm very gently
    in a saucepan with 1/2 cup water, stirring until it all melts and heats through.

  directions:
  - 1. Place dried ancho and guajillo chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave
    until pliable and toasty-smelling, 10 to 20 seconds. Transfer to the jar of a
    blender and add chipotle peppers, orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, soy sauce,
    fish sauce, garlic, cilantro, cumin seed, coriander seed, and brown sugar. Blend
    until a smooth sauce has formed, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Transfer
    half of the salsa to a large bowl and the other half to a sealed container. Set
    aside the sealed container in the refrigerator.
  - 2. Add an extra 2 teaspoons of salt to the salsa in the bowl. It should taste
    slightly saltier than is comfortable to taste. Add 1 piece of steak to bowl and
    turn to coat. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag with the top folded over
    to prevent excess sauce and meat juices from contaminating the seal. Repeat with
    remaining steak, adding it all to the same bag. Pour any excess marinade over
    the steak. Squeeze all air out of the bag and seal. Refrigerate for at least 3
    hours and up to overnight.
  - 3. When ready to cook, remove the extra salsa from the fridge to allow it to warm
    up a little. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit
    and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal
    grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.
    Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting,
    cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.
  - "4. Remove steak from marinade and wipe off excess. Place directly over the hot\
    \ side of the grill. If using a gas grill, cover; if using a charcoal grill, leave\
    \ exposed. Cook, turning occasionally, until steak is well charred on outside\
    \ and center registers 110\xB0F on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 10 minutes\
    \ total. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly\
    \ against the grain and serve immediately, passing extra salsa, lime wedges, avocado,\
    \ onions, cilantro, and tortillas on the side."

  directions:
  - Cake
  - Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  - Combine chocolate and water, stir over low heat until chocolate is melted. Set
    aside and allow to cool.
  - Beat egg whites to stiff peaks. Set aside.
  - Combine dry ingredients. Set aside.
  - In a large mixing bowl cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy (2-3 minutes).
    Add egg yolks one at a time and beat well after each addition.
  - Add vanilla and cooled chocolate to mixture. Mix well.
  - Add alternating additions of the dry mixture and buttermilk, beating well after
    each addition.
  - Fold in egg whites.
  - Bake in 2 greased 9 inch pans until toothpick comes out clean (about 25 minutes
    for me at high altitude, may take up to 35 minutes)
  - 'Pecan-Coconut Filling:'
  - Pulse your pecans in your food processor until they are a course crumb texture.
    Set aside.
  - Toast your coconut in the oven using the broiler on high, watching closely to
    prevent burning. Allow them to develop color for 4-5 minutes and then stir them,
    bringing the untoasted coconut to the top. After the initial few minutes it will
    cook faster, so watch carefully and stir frequently until you when you have nice
    golden color and fragrant smell. Set aside, reserving 1/2 cup for decorating.
  - 'Make the custard base: mix cream, sugar and egg yolks in a medium saucepan. Stir
    continually over medium heat until it is thick and coats the back of a spoon.
    If you are not confident it is finished you may check that it has reached 170
    degrees with an instant read thermometer.'
  - Removed from heat and add nuts, toasted coconut, butter and rum. Stir together
    until butter is melted. Cool to room temperature.
  - Ganache
  - Melt coconut oil in medium saucepan. Add chocolate, corn syrup and rum.
  - In small saucepan heat cream until just beginning to boil.
  - Pour cream over chocolate mixture and stir until smooth. If chocolate does not
    melt completely, stir continually over low heat until chocolate is melted.
  - Cool until thickened but still spreadable, around 20-30 minutes.
  - Assembling The Cake
  - Spread Coconut Pecan Frosting between the two cooled cake layers.
  - Spread the ganache over the whole cake slowly, using a butter knife or frosting
    knife to guide it down sides and smooth all around.
  - Add the remaining Coconut Pecan Frosting in heaping spoonfuls to the top of the
    cake and spread gently to add a layer of this frosting over the top of the ganache
    layer.
  - Add the remaining toasted coconut to the sides of the cake. You can press the
    coconut gently onto the ganache with a spoon or very gently toss small handfuls
    of it onto the sides so it sticks to the ganache.

    dislodging any browned bits. Cook for 2 minutes. Toss in the parsley, reduce the
    heat to medium-low.
  - 5. While the mushrooms are cooking, start the pasta. Cook according to package
    instructions, subtracting about a minute off the finished time. When ready, scoop
    out about a quarter cup of the pasta water and set aside. Drain the pasta and
    then immediately toss with the mushroom sauce. Add the water if it needs to be
    more substantial. Sprinkle with Parmesan.

  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350\xBA and butter and flour two 9\" cake pans. Prepare red velvet\
    \ cake batter according to box instructions."
  - Divide batter among prepared cake pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in
    the center comes out clean, 30 to 32 minutes. Let cool slightly in cake pans,
    then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. Using a serrated knife, level
    out tops of the cake so they're flat (save scraps for decorating!).
  - 'Make cheesecake layer: Line a 9" springform pan with parchment and spray with
    cooking spray. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer
    fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and sugar until fluffy and
    combined, 3 minutes. Add eggs, one a time, until combined. Add sour cream, flour,
    vanilla, and salt and beat until combined.'
  - Pour filling into prepared springform pan and bake until only slightly jiggly
    in the center, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly, then transfer to the freezer to
    cool completely and firm up before assembling.
  - 'Make cream cheese frosting: In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until
    light and fluffy, then add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until combined.'
  - 'Assemble cake: On a cake platter, place one red velvet cake. Top with cheesecake
    layer, pressing down firmly, then top with second red velvet cake.'
  - Using an offset spatula, frost cake with cream cheese frosting.
  - Garnish with red velvet cake crumbs before serving.

    * 30 mins + 15 mins on beef was not enough to shred.  Tried chopping it, but I
    really like shredding better.

    * 15 mins on potatoes was to much and with quick release they got shredded

    * 15 mins on carrots was good'

  directions:
  - Bring a pot of salted water to boil. Add potatoes, skins removed and boil for
    20 minutes until fork tender (you can stick your fork into the potato and it slides
    right out).
  - While the potatoes are boiling, Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegan butter in a pan
    over medium high heat.
  - When hot, add the onion slices in (the onions should sizzle), and reduce heat
    to medium so you don't burn the onions.
  - Swirl the onions around to ensure it's all covered, and allow to caramelise for
    15 minutes, stirring once every 5 minutes. The onions will be soft enough to cut
    through with the spatula, and will be very tender. If the oil in the pan dries
    up, add water 2 tablespoons at a time to help finish cooking the onions. Set aside.
  - Drain and place into a bowl. Using your potato mashed, mash the potatoes for a
    few seconds until broken up. Place the coconut milk and the remaining vegan butter
    in a bowl and microwave for 45 seconds until hot. Add to the mashed potatoes with
    the garlic and salt and mashed all the ingredients together with the potato masher
    until incorporated.
  - Fold in the caramelised onions into the mashed potatoes. If you have time, you
    can let it sit for a while so the caramelised flavour seeps into the mashed potatoes.
  - Serve with black pepper (optional) and an extra pat of butter.

  directions:
  - 1. Chop reserved turkey neck, gizzards, and trimmings into 1-inch chunks with
    a cleaver. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering.
    Add turkey parts, onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until
    well browned, about 10 minutes total. Add stock, soy sauce, herbs, and bay leaves.
    Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour, then strain through
    a fine-mesh strainer. Add any drippings from the roast turkey, then skim off excess
    fat.
  - 2. You should have a little over 1 quart of fortified stock; if not, add water
    or more chicken stock to equal 1 quart. Discard solids and set stock aside.
  - 3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring
    constantly, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add fortified
    broth in a thin, steady stream. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook
    until thickened and reduced to about 3 cups. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
    Gravy can be made up to 5 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.

  directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (232 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment
    paper, or line with foil and grease well.
  - In a large bowl, stir together the chopped cauliflower, onions, celery, and garlic.
    Toss with olive oil, poultry seasoning, sage, thyme, sea salt, and black pepper.
  - Spread the mixture in a single layer on the lined baking sheet. (You may need
    two sheets depending on the size. You want as many of the cauliflower florets
    and onions in contact with the pan as possible.) Roast in the oven for about 15
    minutes, until the onions are soft and cauliflower is starting to brown a little.
  - Add the fresh parsley and pecans to the pan, and stir everything together. Roast
    for 10-15 more minutes, until the pecans are lightly toasted, cauliflower is well
    browned, and onions are starting to caramelize.

  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 400\xB0F. "
  - In a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook elbow macaroni until just shy of
    al dente, about 2 minutes less than cooking time indicated on package. Drain,
    then transfer pasta to a large mixing bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons (30g) butter
    until butter is melted and pasta is evenly coated. Set aside.
  - In a large saucepan, bring 3 cups (720ml) milk to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk
    in sodium citrate until fully dissolved. While maintaining a gentle simmer, add
    cheddar cheese in small increments, using an immersion blender to incorporate
    it completely into the sauce before the next addition. When all the cheese is
    added and the sauce is smooth and glossy, blend in hot sauce, mustard powder,
    and garlic powder. Season with salt, if necessary.
  - "Scrape cheese sauce into pasta and mix until evenly coated. Let cool slightly,\
    \ then add grated Gruy\xE8re and mix well. Scrape pasta into a 9- by 13-inch baking\
    \ dish and smooth surface into an even layer."
  - Bake on top rack of oven until browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes (ovens can
    vary; check often to prevent top from burning).
  - When mac is almost done, add 3 tbsp of butter to a skillet and melt over medium
    heat.  Add panko and cook until browned
  - Let mac and cheese rest 15 minutes, then top with browned panko crumbs and serve.
    Leftover mac and cheese can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; it reheats surprisingly
    well in the microwave or oven.

  directions:
  - 1. Combine flour, yeast, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk
    until combined. Add yogurt and knead with dough hook on low speed until dough
    comes together into a smooth ball. Dough should stick slightly to bottom of bowl
    as it kneads (add slightly more yogurt or milk as necessary). Continue to knead
    for 5 minutes. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature
    until roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
  - 2. Turn dough out onto floured work surface. Using a bench scraper or a knife,
    cut the dough into 12 even pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then place on
    a well-floured surface (leaving a few inches of space between each one) and cover
    with a floured cloth. Alternatively, place each ball of dough in an individual
    covered pint-sized deli container. Allow dough to rise at room temperature until
    doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
  - 3. Ignite a large chimney full of coals (about 5 quarts of coals) and spread evenly
    over half of the grill. Set grill grates in place, cover, and allow to preheat
    for 5 minutes. Scrape grill grates clean with a brush.
  - 4. Working with two to three balls of dough at a time, stretch with your hands
    into an oblong roughly 10-inches long and 6-inches across (you can use a rolling
    pin for this as well). Once you have two or three pieces stretched, lay them out
    on the grill above the coals. Cook without moving until bottom side is charred
    in spots and light golden brown. Flip with a large spatula, pizza pell, or with
    tongs and cook until second side is charred and browned. Remove naan from the
    grill and immediately brush with melted butter. Transfer the naan to a large plate
    and cover it with a clean dish towel while you cook the remaining bread.

  directions:
  - "1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450\xB0F. Line a rimmed\
    \ baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil. Scatter 2/3rds of onions, carrots,\
    \ celery and thyme sprigs across bottom of pan. Place slotted broiler rack or\
    \ wire rack directly on top of vegetables."
  - 2. Pat turkey dry with paper towels and rub on all surfaces with 1 tablespoon
    oil. Season liberally on all surfaces with salt and black pepper (if using a brined,
    salted, or Kosher turkey, omit salting step, see note). Tuck wing tips behind
    back. Place turkey on top of rack, arranging so that it does not overlap the edges,
    pressing down on the breast bone to flatten the breasts slightly.
  - "3. Transfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant\
    \ read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the breast registers 150\xB0\
    F, and the thighs register at least 165\xB0F, about 80 minutes."
  - 4. While turkey roasts, make the gravy. Roughly chop the neck, backbone, and giblets.
    Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 3 quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering.
    Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned,
    about 5 minutes. Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook,
    stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, another
    5 minutes. Add chicken stock, remaining thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil
    and reduce to a bare simmer. Allow to cook 45 minutes, then strain through a fine
    mesh strainer into a 2 quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off
    any fat from the surface of the broth.
  - 5. Melt butter over medium-high heat in a 2 quart saucepan. Add flour and cook,
    stirring constantly until flour is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly,
    add broth in a thin, steady stream until it it all incorporated. Bring to a boil,
    reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced to about 1 quart, about 20 minutes
    longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep gravy warm.
  - 6. When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet.
    Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour
    any collected juices from out of the roasting pan through a fine-mesh strainer
    into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and dicard. Whisk juices into
    gravy.
  - 7. Carve turkey and serve with gravy

  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 360\xB0F | 180\xB0C."
  - Place chicken thighs in a large shallow dish and season with salt; set aside.
  - In a large mixing jug, whisk together the honey, lemon juice, soy sauce, vinegar
    and minced garlic. Pour about 1/4 cup of the sauce over the chicken (or just enough
    to lightly coat each thigh) and rotate each thigh to coat evenly in the sauce.
  - Heat a non-stick skillet over medium high heat; sear the chicken skin side down
    first until golden for about 5 minutes. Turn and repeat on the other side. Repeat
    with remaining chicken.
  - Arrange chicken skin-side on a baking sheet or casserole dish; add the whole garlic
    cloves between the chicken; pour half of the remaining sauce over each thigh (about
    1-2 tablespoons per thigh) and bake for 40-45 minutes until the chicken is cooked
    through and the juices run clear. The skin should be crispy and sticky.
  - While the chicken is baking, pour the remaining sauce into a small saucepan, and
    bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat down to low and allow to simmer
    while occasionally stirring; lifting the pot off of the heat when the sauce bubbles
    up to the rim of your pot, and repeat the process until the sauce has sightly
    reduced and thickened (about 6 minutes).
  - Serve with the remaining sauce, lemon zest and slices, and sliced green onions
    (optional).

  - "To prep the kohlrabi, remove the leaves and save them for another use. Then weigh\
    \ out 1 \xBD pounds of stems. Trim the ends and peel thickly with a paring knife\
    \ to remove all the woody exterior."
  - Use the julienne blade of a mandoline slicer, the large holes of a box grater,
    or a chef's knife to cut into matchsticks or shred.
  - Add kolrabi to bowl and stir gently but thoroughly to coat.
  - Wash kohlrabi well, trim ends, and peel thickly with a paring knife.
  - Using the julienne blade of a mandoline slicer or the large holes on a box grater,
    cut or shred the kohlrabi.
  - Into a large bowl, place the mayonnaise, mustards, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic,
    tarragon, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.
  - Add the julienned kohlrabi to the bowl and toss gently to coat well with the dressing.
  - Serve cold or at room temperature as an accompaniment to grilled fish, shellfish,
    chicken, meat, and more.

  - Cook red quinoa by the instructions
  - '* Note to make the cream smoother soak cashews for 5 hours in water'
  - 'Make the Cashew Cream: In a blender, combine the cashews, water, olive oil, lemon
    juice and sea salt and blend until creamy. Chill until ready to use.'
  - 'Make the Spiced Quinoa: In a medium bowl, mix together the quinoa, garlic, chili

  directions:
  - 1. Cover potatoes with salted water in a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high
    heat. Simmer uncovered until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
  - "2. Meanwhile heat 2 tablespoons butter and olive oil in a large saut\xE9 pan\
    \ over low heat until melted. Add onions, cover, and cook, stirring periodically\
    \ until soft and translucent, about 15 minutes. Remove cover, add sugar, season\
    \ with salt and pepper and stir. Raise heat to medium-high and allow to caramelize,\
    \ stirring often and adding water a tablespoon at a time if onions begin to burn,\
    \ about 15 minutes longer."
  - 3. When potatoes are done cooking, drain in a colander and return to pan. Add
    remaining 5 tablespoons butter, milk, sour cream and cream cheese. Mash potatoes
    by hand using a potato masher, leaving some texture. Season to taste with salt
    and pepper.
  - 4. Fold in onions. Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed. Serve immediately,
    or store in the refrigerator for up to two days and reheat in a covered heavy
    dish in the oven or on the stovetop over low heat, stirring frequently.

  directions:
  - A 12- by 5-inch loaf of Italian bread from the bakery section of the supermarket,
    which has a soft, thin crust and fine crumb, works best in this recipe. We do
    not recommend using a rustic or crusty artisan-style loaf. A rasp-style grater
    makes quick work of turning the garlic into a paste. If you bake the bread on
    a dark baking sheet, start checking for doneness after 4 minutes after flipping
    the bread in step 3.
  - Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven 450 degrees
  - In a medium bowl add 4 tablespoons butter, salt and cayenne to bowl and set aside
  - 'In a separate bowl combine garlic powder and water in medium bowl. '
  - 'Place remaining 4 tablespoons butter in small bowl and microwave, covered, until
    melted, about 30 seconds. '
  - 'Stir in garlic and continue to microwave, covered, until mixture is bubbling
    around edges, about 1 minute, stirring halfway through. '
  - Transfer garlic-butter mixture to bowl with garlic powder mixture and whisk together
    until it forms homogenous loose paste. (If mixture melts, set aside until it solidifies
    before using.)
  - 'Spread cut sides of loaf evenly with butter mixture. Transfer bread, cut side
    up, to baking sheet. Bake until butter has melted into surface of bread and bread
    is hot, 3 to 4 minutes. '
  - Remove baking sheet from oven. Flip bread, cut side down, place second rimmed
    baking sheet on top and gently press. Return bread to oven, with second baking
    sheet on top of bread, and continue to bake until cut side of bread is golden
    brown and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes longer(check every so often to not over brown),
    rotating the baking sheet halfway through. Transfer bread to cutting board. Using
    serrated knife cut each half into 8 slices and serve immediately.

  directions:
  - 1. Sprinkle gelatin over chicken stock in a small bowl or liquid measuring cup.
    Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
  - "2. Combine 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and half of paprika in a small\
    \ bowl. Season steaks generously on all sides with mixture (you may not need all\
    \ the mixture) and press with the flat of your hand to adhere. Heat half of vegetable\
    \ oil in a large skillet or saut\xE9 pan over high heat until lightly smoking.\
    \ Add meat and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on both sides and\
    \ center of steaks register 115\xB0F at the thickest part for rare or 125\xB0\
    F for medium-rare. Remove from pan, transfer to a plate, and set aside."
  - 3. Add remaining vegetable oil to the same pan and add the mushrooms. Return to
    medium heat and cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until mushrooms have released
    their liquid and are just starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon
    butter and pearl onions and continue to cook, stirring, until onions and mushrooms
    are softened and well browned, about 6 minutes longer.
  - 4. Add shallots, thyme, and remaining paprika, and cook, stirring, until fragrant.
    Add soy sauce, Worcetershire sauce, fish sauce, and mustard and cook, stirring,
    until mostly evaporated, about 30 seconds. Add any collected juices from the plate
    with the meat, followed by white wine. Cook until reduced to just a few tablespoons.
  - 5. Add broth/gelatin mixture and bring to a heavy simmer. Carefully pour off liquid
    into a heatproof cup or liquid measuring cup. Add sour cream to a medium bowl.
    Whisking constantly, slowly pour hot liquid over sour cream and whisk until fully
    homogenous.
  - 6. Return sour cream mixture to pan along with remaining 2 tablespoons butter.
    Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.
    Return steaks to pan until barely warmed through, about 1 minute. Remove from
    heat.
  - 7. Cook noodles according to package directions. When cooked, drain and return
    to pot, reserving 1 cup of pasta cooking water. Transfer steaks to a cutting board
    and pour the sauce, mushrooms, and onions over the noodles. Stir to coat pasta,
    adding pasta cooking water as necessary until it reaches a loose, creamy consistency.
    Stir in half of minced parsley.
  - 8. Thinly slice steaks. To serve, divide pasta and cream sauce evenly between
    4 hot serving bowls. Top with sliced steak, spooning a little extra sauce over
    them. Add a dollop of sour cream, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve,
    advising guests to remove large thyme sprigs as they find them.

    \ to check temperature, or chicken will burn."

  directions:
  - 'Prepare the potatoes:'
  - Boil potatoes in a large stockpot 30 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork.
    While the potatoes are boiling, preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare
    a baking sheet.
  - Drain cooked potatoes and spread on prepared baking sheet to cool. Once potatoes
    are cool enough to touch, use the flat side of a fork or a potato masher to press
    into the center of each potato until it smashes. Remove the fork just before you
    reach the bottom of the potato to hold it together. Brush with grapeseed oil and
    sprinkle with salt and pepper.
  - Place baking sheet on the center rack of the oven and bake 30 minutes, or until
    the edges of the potatoes turn brown and crispy.
  - 'Prepare the chimichurri sauce:'
  - While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the chimichurri sauce. Whisk parsley,
    cilantro, red wine vinegar, garlic, crushed red pepper and salt and pepper. Stir
    in extra virgin olive oil and allow the sauce to sit at room temperature for at
    least 20 minutes.
  - 'Serve:'
  - Remove potatoes from the oven and transfer to a serving dish. Spoon chimichurri
    on top of each potato. Serve any remaining sauce on the side if desired.

  directions:
  - "1. Preheat the oven to 350\xB0F, with a rack in the middle position."
  - "2. Make the frosting. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth. In\
    \ a medium saucepan, bring the sugar and coconut milk to a boil over medium-high\
    \ heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Slowly whisk about a cup of the hot\
    \ milk mixture into the yolks to temper them, then pour the contents of the bowl\
    \ back into the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with\
    \ a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens enough to hold a line drawn with\
    \ a finger down the back of the spoon, about 10 minutes. (Be careful not to let\
    \ the mixture boil.) Stir in the butter, toasted coconut, and pecans, then pour\
    \ the frosting into a shallow baking pan. Cover the surface with plastic wrap\
    \ and let the frosting cool until it\u2019s spreadable."
  - 3. Meanwhile, make the cake. Butter three 9-inch round cake pans and dust with
    cocoa powder. In a large bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder, sugar, flour,
    baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg,
    milk, oil, vanilla, and melted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients
    and whisk until well combined and smooth. Whisk in the boiling water.
  - 4. Pour the batter (which will be quite thin) into the prepared pans. Bake until
    the layers spring back when lightly touched, about 12 minutes. Let cool completely
    in the pans.
  - 5. Unmold the cake layers. Put one layer on a serving plate and spread one-third
    of the frosting over the top. Cover with another layer, spread with another one-third
    of the frosting, and then repeat the process one more time. The cake will keep
    for up to 3 days.

  directions:
  - First, you're going to make the cashew cream sauce. Start by boiling the raw cashews
    in water for 10 minutes and then carefully drain the water out and discard it.
  - Put the cashews, unsweetened coconut milk, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, salt,
    and pepper into a high-powered blender. Blend on high until the cashew cream sauce
    is smooth and creamy. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
  - In a medium pan over medium heat, saute the diced onions in 2-3 tbsp of low-sodium
    vegetable broth until the onions are translucent. Add the chopped artichokes and
    garlic and saute for 2-3 minutes.
  - Add the cashew cream sauce that you made, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder,
    nutmeg, and nutritional yeast to the pan with the sauteed veggies and stir everything
    together.
  - Lastly, stir in the frozen spinach, mix it together, and let it cook for 10-15
    minutes or until hot and bubbly. The mixture will continue to thicken as it cooks.
    You can eat the dip just like this with chips or veggies or you can top it with
    vegan cheese and bake it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

  ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 cups raw cashews (Boil for 10 minutes or soak for 2-3 hours)
  - 2 cups unsweetened coconut milk (or unsweetened cashew or almond milk)
  - 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice (about 1 medium lemon)
  - 1 1/2 tbsp raw apple cider vinegar
  - 1/2 tsp sea salt (more to taste)
  - 1/4 tsp black pepper
  - 2-3 tbsp low-sodium vegetable broth
  - 1 medium red onion diced
  - 3 garlic cloves minced
  - (2) 14 oz cans artichoke hearts in water, rinsed, drained, and roughly chopped
  - 4 tbsp nutritional yeast
  - 1 tsp paprika
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp onion powder
  - 1/8 tsp nutmeg
  - (3) 10 oz bags frozen spinach

  name: Healthy Cashew Cream Spinach Artichoke Dip
  notes: 'Make sure to use raw cashews to make this dip so you can control the amount
    of salt that is in the spinach dip.


    Don''t skip boiling the raw cashews for 10 minutes prior to blending them because
    it helps the cashews to break down and boiling the nuts (or soaking for 2-3 hours)
    makes it easier for your body to digest.


    Do not use sweetened or vanilla-flavored plant milk, it will make the dip taste
    sweet instead of savory. My favorite plant milk to use is unsweetened coconut
    milk (from a carton), unsweetened cashew milk, or unsweetened almond milk.


    While you''re cooking the spinach dip, you may need to add more vegetable broth
    if it gets too dry. The dip should be very saucy and rich.


    Store the leftover vegan spinach artichoke dip in an airtight container in the
    fridge for 4-5 days or freeze it for a future snack.'

  directions:
  - 1. Place dried ancho and guajillo chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave
    until pliable and toasty-smelling, 10 to 20 seconds. Transfer to the jar of a
    blender and add chipotle peppers, orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, soy sauce,
    fish sauce, garlic, cilantro, cumin seed, coriander seed, and brown sugar. Blend
    until a smooth sauce has formed, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Transfer
    half of the salsa to a large bowl and the other half to a sealed container. Set
    aside the sealed container in the refrigerator.
  - 2. Add an extra 2 teaspoons of salt to the salsa in the bowl. It should taste
    slightly saltier than is comfortable to taste. Add 1 piece of steak to bowl and
    turn to coat. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag with the top folded over
    to prevent excess sauce and meat juices from contaminating the seal. Repeat with
    remaining steak, adding it all to the same bag. Pour any excess marinade over
    the steak. Squeeze all air out of the bag and seal. Refrigerate for at least 3
    hours and up to overnight.
  - 3. When ready to cook, remove the extra salsa from the fridge to allow it to warm
    up a little. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit
    and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal
    grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.
    Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting,
    cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.
  - "4. Remove steak from marinade and wipe off excess. Place directly over the hot\
    \ side of the grill. If using a gas grill, cover; if using a charcoal grill, leave\
    \ exposed. Cook, turning occasionally, until steak is well charred on outside\
    \ and center registers 110\xB0F on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 10 minutes\
    \ total. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly\
    \ against the grain and serve immediately, passing extra salsa, lime wedges, avocado,\
    \ onions, cilantro, and tortillas on the side."

  directions:
  - "Dice the onion and heat up a few splashes of olive oil in the pan. Once hot,\
    \ saut\xE9 the onions. You can absolutely use more onion, and in my opinion, the\
    \ more oniony the dish, the better. It adds a nice texture, and you can use less\
    \ meat, which embodies the true Indian spirit. Once onions are looking transparent-ish,\
    \ add the ground beef."
  - While the beef is cooking, cut your tomato in half. Set one half aside (for garnish
    purposes) and dice the other half. De-seed and finely chop the small green chillies.
    Chop half of the cilantro.
  - When the beef is browned and there are no visible pink bits, add the diced tomatoes,
    chopped peppers, and chopped cilantro.
  - Add two tablespoons ginger garlic paste and the spice mix, mixing until all ingredients
    are evenly distributed.
  - "After most of the liquid has cooked down, crack three eggs directly into the\
    \ pan and mix them in, so little white/yellow flecks are visible in the meat\u2014\
    this part should only take a few minutes. Once the egg has cooked, keep the pan\
    \ on very low heat. At this point, take a taste, and add any needed salt, because\
    \ you haven\u2019t done that yet."
  - Now begins the assembly process.
  - "Preheat oven to 350\u2109. Take the casserole pan, and spread a little butter\
    \ or ghee on the bottom of the pan. Add two parathas to cover the bottom of the\
    \ pan. Add a layer of meat, roughly a quarter-inch thick, smoothing it down with\
    \ a spatula or large spoon. Don\u2019t over-do it with the meat layer. If you\
    \ have extra, this meat mixture is a perfect sloppy joe mix, or a delicious fusion\
    \ dish just waiting for some crushed tomatoes and pasta."
  - Lay down another layer of parathas, and spread a couple tablespoons of mint chutney
    on top. Add another layer of meat, smoothing and patting down as before. Cover
    with a final layer of parathas, and brush with a bit of ghee/butter on top. Put
    the whole thing in the oven for 10 minutes.

  directions:
  - Preheat your grill for high heat direct cooking and rub the grates down with a
    wadded paper towel dipped in cooking oil (set aside to use again later).
  - Use a microplane to zest the orange and pulverize the garlic into a small bowl
    with the fennel fronds.
  - Slice the orange in half, rub lightly with olive oil, and place cut-side down
    directly over the fire. Cook for a minute or two until the oranges become deeply
    charred, then juice them into the bowl with the fennel. Stir in the white wine
    vinegar and kosher salt, then cover and set aside at room temperature while you
    make the burgers.
  - "Use the bread as a guide to cut perfectly sized watermelon burger \u201Cpatties,\u201D\
    \ then coat them well with olive oil and season them with a sprinkle of kosher\
    \ salt. Rub the grill grates with the oily paper towel once again, then put the\
    \ burgers directly over the flames. Cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, moving\
    \ around the grill as needed to keep from burning."
  - Toast the buns lightly, then top with watermelon, cheese, a few coarse cracks
    of black pepper, and a few spoonfuls of the gremolata. Serve immediately.

  directions:
  - Slice the chicken into bite-sized chunks. Combine the cubed chicken with the yogurt,
    lemon juice, garlic, ginger, salt, cumin, garam masala, and paprika and stir until
    well-coated.
  - Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.
  - "Preheat the oven to 500\xB0F (260\xB0C). Line a high-sided baking pan or roasting\
    \ tray with parchment paper."
  - Place the marinated chicken pieces on bamboo or wooden skewers, then set them
    over the prepared baking pan, making sure there is space underneath the chicken
    to help distribute the heat more evenly. Bake for about 15 minutes, until slightly
    dark brown on the edges.
  - "Make the sauce: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, then saut\xE9 the\
    \ onions, ginger, and garlic until tender but not browned. Add the cumin, turmeric,\
    \ coriander, paprika, chili powder, and garam masala and stir constantly for about\
    \ 30 seconds, until the spices are fragrant. Stir in the tomato puree, tomato\
    \ sauce, and 1 \xBC cups of water, then bring to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes.\
    \ Pour in the cream."
  - Remove the chicken from the skewers and add to the sauce, cooking for another
    1-2 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and serve over rice or alongside naan bread.
  - Enjoy!

    \ need 18 cavities, so you can use 2 tins, 1 tin with 18 cavities \u2014 if you\
    \ can find it \u2014 or use a single tin but cook the puffs in 2 batches.)"
  - Place the cashews, milk, lemon juice, garlic, and salt into a food processor and
    blend until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
  - Drain the spinach and squeeze it to remove as much moisture as possible. Add the
    spinach to the food processor bowl, along with the onion and dill. Pulse until
    the ingredients are fully mixed.
  - Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 3 strips of equal length, and then cut each
    strip into thirds, making 18 squares. Place each square into the bottom of a muffin
    cavity, stretching it out just a bit by hand if needed so the corners reach a
    bit beyond the top of the cavity. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the spinach mixture
    into each puff pastry square. Fold the corners of each square inward and pinch
    then together at the center. Brush the top of each puff with a bit of olive oil.
  - Bake until the puffs are lightly browned and puffy, about 25 minutes. Remove the
    tins from the oven and allow them to cool a bit before removing the puffs. Loosen
    the puffs from the tin by placing a knife down the side, between the puff and
    the tin.

  directions:
  - 1. Pour stock into small small bowl or liquid measuring cup and evenly sprinkle
    gelatin over surface of stock. Set aside.
  - 2. In a large 12-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high
    heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring
    frequently with a wooden spoon, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are
    deeply browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
  - 3. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant
    and shallots are softened, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add wine or sherry, and cook,
    swirling pan and scraping up any stuck-on bits with a wooden spoon, until wine
    is reduced by half, about 30 seconds.
  - 4. Add chicken stock mixture, season lightly with salt, and bring to a simmer.
    Reduce heat to medium-low, add fish sauce (if using), and cook, stirring occasionally,
    until mushroom mixture is thickened to a saucy consistency, about 5 minutes. Turn
    off heat.
  - 5. Meanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta. If using dry pasta,
    cook until just shy of al dente (1 to 2 minutes less than the package directs).
    If using fresh pasta, cook until noodles are barely cooked through. Using either
    a spider skimmer (for short pasta) or tongs (for long fresh pasta), transfer pasta
    to pan with mushrooms along with 3/4 cup (180ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively,
    drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at
    least 2 cups (475ml) pasta cooking water.
  - 6. Heat sauce and pasta over high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until
    pasta is al dente (fresh pasta will never be truly al dente) and sauce is thickened
    and coats noodles, 1 to 2 minutes, adding more pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup
    (60ml) increments as needed. At this point, the sauce should coat the pasta but
    still be loose enough to pool around the edges of the pan. Add the butter, and
    stir and toss rapidly to melt and emulsify into the sauce. Remove from heat, add
    3/4 of grated cheese and all of the parsley, and stir rapidly to incorporate.
    Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, passing remaining grated cheese
    at the table.

  directions:
  - Heat butter in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat until melted. Add
    leeks, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, until very soft but
    not browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
  - Add stock, potatoes, and bay leaf, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Bring
    to a boil over high heat, reduce to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook until potatoes
    are fall-apart tender, about 15 minutes.
  - 'To Finish With a Ricer (Recommended): Remove potatoes from soup using tongs and
    transfer to a bowl. Set aside. Discard bay leaf. Transfer remaining soup to a
    blender. Slowly increase blender speed to high and blend until completely smooth,
    about 2 minutes. Return soup to a clean pot.'
  - Press potatoes through a potato ricer or food mill into the pot with the soup.
    Whisk in buttermilk and heavy cream. Whisking frequently, bring soup to a simmer
    over medium-high heat. Whisk in grated nutmeg. Season to taste with salt and pepper
    and serve with chives or scallions.
  - 'To Finish With a Blender (Faster): Add heavy cream and buttermilk to pot. Discard
    bay leaf. Working in batches if necessary, transfer soup to a blender. Slowly
    increase blender speed to high and blend until completely smooth, about 2 minutes.
    Return soup to a clean pot, pressing it through a fine mesh strainer or chinois
    with the bottom of a ladle if a smoother texture is desired. Whisking frequently,
    bring soup to a simmer over medium-high heat. Alternatively, chill completely
    and serve cold. Whisk in grated nutmeg. Season to taste with salt and pepper and
    serve with chives or scallions.'

  directions:
  - 1. Using a mortar and pestle, combine garlic and sea salt and grind to a paste.
  - 2. Add pine nuts and continue to crush with pestle, smashing and grinding them,
    until a sticky, only slightly chunky, beige paste forms.
  - 3. Add basil leaves, a handful at a time, and pound and grind against the walls
    of the mortar. Continue until all basil leaves have been crushed to fine bits.
  - 4. Add both cheeses, then slowly drizzle in olive oil, working it into the pesto
    with the pestle until a fairly smooth, creamy, emulsified, sauce forms. Add more
    oil, if desired.

  - Cover the potatoes with water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20
    until they are fork tender.
  - In the meantime, in a medium saucepan, combine the garlic, non-dairy milk and
    coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.

  - "Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450\xB0F/230\xB0C (or\
    \ 400\xB0F/200\xB0C if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large\
    \ pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce;\
    \ 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer,\
    \ and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk,\
    \ about 10 minutes after returning to a boil."
  - Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and
    a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook,
    stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden,
    about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a
    large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.
  - "When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about\
    \ 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused\
    \ oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking\
    \ bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato\u2013like paste has built\
    \ up on the potato chunks."
  - Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading
    them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using
    a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn
    potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over,
    turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.
  - Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley.
    Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

  notes: 'Russet potatoes will produce crisper crusts and fluffier centers. Yukon
    Golds will be slightly less crisp and have creamier centers, with a darker color
    and deeper flavor. You can also use a mix of the two.


    The potatoes should be cut into very large chunks, at least 2 to 3 inches or so.
    For medium-sized Yukon Golds, this means cutting them in half crosswise, then
    splitting each half again to make quarters. For larger Yukon Golds or russets,
    you can cut the potatoes into chunky sixths or eighths.'

    it out into a patty.

    patty around the cheese, into a ball shape. Set aside on baking sheet and repeat
    until all the meat is completed.

  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - 1. With a sharp chef's knife, split chicken breasts in half horizontally. Working
    one piece at a time, place inside a plastic zipper-lock bag and pound with a meat
    pounder or the bottom of a skillet to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Transfer to
    a large bowl.
  - 2. Add 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and minced garlic to bowl. Season with 2 tablespoons
    kosher salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Turn chicken with hands
    until salt, pepper, and garlic are evenly incorporated and all the chicken is
    coated in buttermilk mixture. Transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out the
    air, and seal. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight (see note).
  - 3. Meanwhile, place bread slices on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Leave
    out on counter for at least 4 hours and up to overnight until mostly dried.
  - 4. The next day, break bread into rough pieces (leave the wire rack in the rimmed
    baking sheet) and combine with 4 ounces Parmesan cheese in the food processor.
    Season with black pepper. Process until bread is finely ground, about 20 seconds.
    Transfer mixture to a large shallow bowl or pie plate.
  - 5. Place flour in a second shallow bowl or pie plate. Whisk eggs, 2 tablespoons
    buttermilk, and 1 tablespoon of the flour in a third pie plate. Drizzle remaining
    2 tablespoons buttermilk over the breadcrumb/Parmesan mixture and incorporate
    with your fingertips. The mixture should be mealy, but hold together in clumps
    if you squeeze it together with your hands.
  - 6. Working one piece of chicken at a time, remove from the bag and add to flour.
    Turn to coat, shake off excess, and add to egg mixture. Turn to coat, letting
    excess drip off, and add to breadcrumb mixture. Turn to coat, piling crumbs on
    top and pressing down firmly so a thick layer adheres. Transfer coated chicken
    to the wire rack and repeat with remaining chicken breasts.
  - "7. Preheat oven to 425\xB0F. Place sauce in a medium saucepan and heat over low\
    \ heat, stirring occasionally, until barely simmering. Remove from heat and set\
    \ aside."
  - "8. Heat oil in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until\
    \ it registers 375 to 400\xB0F on an instant read or deep-frying thermometer.\
    \ Working in batches, carefully add chicken by lowering the cutlets away from\
    \ you into the oil. Add as many cutlets as will fit in one layer (2 to 3)."
  - 9. Cook, swirling pan gently and using a thin flexible metal spatula to loosen
    chicken if it sticks, until chicken is golden-brown and crisp on bottom side,
    about 2 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula and a fork, carefully flip chicken
    and cook until golden brown on second side. Transfer chicken to a paper-towel
    lined plate to drain and repeat with remaining chicken.
  - 10. Spoon 1/3 of sauce onto the bottom of a casserole or oven-safe serving dish.

  directions:
  - Add all ingredients to a blender or food processor.
  - Blend until completely smooth, about 30 seconds.
  - Taste and season with more salt, if necessary.
  - Transfer to jar, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight,
    before serving to help the flavors really meld together. If you don't have time
    to let it sit, you can serve it immediately.
  - Drizzle on salads, tacos, rice bowls or grilled meats!
  - "ISABEL\u2019S TIPS"
  - After blending all the ingredients together, I recommend letting the dressing
    sit in the fridge for at least 1 hour but preferably overnight to really help
    the flavors meld together. It makes a big difference and is worth the wait!
  - The dressing should be pourable and not too thick. If you want it thicker, blend
    in more plain Greek yogurt until it reaches the consistency you want.
  - "When measuring out the cilantro for this recipe, use the stems and the leaves.\
    \ You can remove any large excess stems (especially if they\u2019re super long),\
    \ but you don\u2019t have to individually pluck off the cilantro leaves."

    purposes) and dice the other half. De-seed and finely chop the small green chillies.
    Chop half of the cilantro.
  - When the beef is browned and there are no visible pink bits, add the diced tomatoes,
    chopped peppers, and chopped cilantro.
  - Add two tablespoons ginger garlic paste and the spice mix, mixing until all ingredients
    are evenly distributed.
  - "After most of the liquid has cooked down, crack three eggs directly into the\
    \ pan and mix them in, so little white/yellow flecks are visible in the meat\u2014\
    this part should only take a few minutes. Once the egg has cooked, keep the pan\
    \ on very low heat. At this point, take a taste, and add any needed salt, because\
    \ you haven\u2019t done that yet."
  - Now begins the assembly process.
  - "Preheat oven to 350\u2109. Take the casserole pan, and spread a little butter\
    \ or ghee on the bottom of the pan. Add two parathas to cover the bottom of the\
    \ pan. Add a layer of meat, roughly a quarter-inch thick, smoothing it down with\
    \ a spatula or large spoon. Don\u2019t over-do it with the meat layer. If you\
    \ have extra, this meat mixture is a perfect sloppy joe mix, or a delicious fusion\
    \ dish just waiting for some crushed tomatoes and pasta."
  - Lay down another layer of parathas, and spread a couple tablespoons of mint chutney
    on top. Add another layer of meat, smoothing and patting down as before. Cover
    with a final layer of parathas, and brush with a bit of ghee/butter on top. Put
    the whole thing in the oven for 10 minutes.
